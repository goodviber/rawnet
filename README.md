* Ruby version - 2.3.3

rake create_numbers to seed database, currently limited to 1000 numbers just for time saving, but will accept 1 million - I quit at 400,000

select box default set to 20, again just to make display smaller, but will accept any number from options.

Drawback of this approach is potentially 1 million database rows...
